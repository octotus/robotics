This repository is a collection of code / scripts written around 2 / 3 themes. 
  1. a ground vehicle that I am working on. It is a very basic device that is controlled by a RPi.
  2. a BLE device that I am building in collaboration with others. This is controlled by ESP32
  3. a collection of other ESP32 code - both BT and BLE code - that I am playing around with.

Each code should be sufficiently commended within. Since these projects are done at my leisure - development in any one branch is not linear. Projects change per my whims.
